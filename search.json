I am passionate about using spatial data and geomatics tools to understand and address real-world environmental challenges. My training and hands-on experience in GIS, remote sensing, and coding with R, Python, and Google Earth Engine enable me to translate complex datasets into actionable insights that support sustainable land use, resource planning, and environmental decision-making. I enjoy connecting field data with analytical tools to inform practical solutions and drive positive environmental outcomes. With extensive experience in land surveying and spatial analysis, I apply precision, technology, and environmental knowledge to solve practical problems. Combining coding, survey work, and spatial analysis has strengthened my ability to deliver accurate, actionable information that supports communities, organizations, and decision-makers in planning and managing resources responsibly. I am committed to advancing environmental management through the practical application of geomatics and survey expertise, translating data into solutions that make a tangible impact."

    "text": "Landscape Connectivity Analysis for Species Movement\nThis project applied landscape ecology principles to evaluate structural and functional connectivity across a heterogeneous landscape using spatial analysis and network-based modeling in R. Using National Land Cover Data, landscape configuration was analyzed to understand how habitat distribution and matrix composition influence species movement and connectivity. Landscape metrics were used to quantify patch structure and spatial patterns, while network analysis techniques were employed to model potential movement pathways across the landscape. The project incorporated resistance-based modeling to simulate species-specific movement scenarios for ducks and spotted owls, accounting for differences in habitat preference and dispersal ability. Graphs and grains of connectivity models were developed across multiple thresholds to assess connectivity sensitivity at different spatial scales. The results highlight how landscape structure, habitat quality, and movement assumptions interact to shape ecological connectivity, demonstrating the value of connectivity modeling for conservation planning and landscape-scale environmental decision-making\nKey methods and Data\nLandscape ecology and connectivity theory, Structural and functional connectivity analysis, Network analysis, National Land Cover Data (NLCD)\nTools\nRstudio (landscapemetrics- Core area metric, Aggregation metric, Area and Edge metric)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis of Fire Burn Severity and Post-Fire Vegetation Recovery Using Landsat Time-Series\nThe Prouton Lakes wildfire (2017) in the Alex Fraser Research Forest, BC, was examined for burn intensity and post-fire vegetation recovery using Landsat 8 surface reflectance time-series (2013-2021). Burn severity was assessed using the normalized burn ratio (NBR) and delta NBR (dNBR), which allowed impacted areas to be classified as unburned, low, medium, or high severity. Vegetation recovery was assessed by observing NDVI trends across burn severity classes for four years after the fire. Time-series composites, supervised classifiers, and statistical visualizations were used to investigate regional patterns of fire effects and vegetation recovery. This study highlights the use of remote sensing and spatial analysis in landscape ecology to aid in wildfire impact assessment and ecosystem management decisions.\nKey methods and Data\nRemote sensing analysis using Landsat 8 OLI Level-2 surface reflectance data, Vegetation and burn indices: NDVI, NBR, dNBR, Time-series processing and compositing for multiple years, Raster pre-processing: masking, cropping, and QA filtering\nTools\nRstudio (raster/terra, ggplot2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCartographic Modelling of Old-Growth Forests on Vancouver Island With Forest Inventories\nAlthough old-growth forests provide important ecological, biological, and wood resources, they are under threat from logging and human disturbances. This lab investigates the distribution of prospective old-growth stands on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, utilizing VRI data, land ownership layers, human disturbance data, and landscape units. Forest polygons were filtered to include managed crown forests, which were then divided into Seral Stages based on age and BEC zone, and human disturbances were adjusted. The percentage of old-growth forest was estimated for each Landscape Unit-BEC combination and compared to provincial targets. Cartographic modelling was used to depict the data, resulting in maps and tables that show locations that exceeded or fell short of the old-growth target. This workflow demonstrates how GIS and Python-based spatial analysis can help with forest management and conservation planning.\nKey methods and Data\nSubsetting VRI polygons to managed forests and extracting relevant attributes, Identifying crown forests using land ownership and human disturbance layers, Assigning Seral Stages (Early, Mid, Mature, Old) based on BEC zones and projected stand age; resetting stages in disturbed areas, Vegetation Resource Inventory 2024 (vancouver_island_vri), Generalized Forest Cover Ownership (vancouver_island_own)\nTools\nArcGIS Pro, Python, SQL"

    "text": "Crime Analysis and Assessment using Data Mining Techniques\nCrimes are actions committed in violation of the law. These crime activities have increased over the years due to high standards of living, unemployment, etc. which need to be curbed to ensure a safe society. Law enforcement agencies can effectively curb the canker by analysing previous crimes to understand the pattern of occurrence of these crimes to gather intelligence to tackle the situation effectively. Initially, law enforcement agencies carry out analysis of crimes on papers or use analogue techniques which is time consuming and tedious as one may have to deal with large paper sizes. In recent years, digital techniques such as the use of artificial intelligence which have proven to be better than traditional techniques are been used to carry out various analyses of crime data. This study has employed digital techniques such as data mining to analyse crime data in Chicago. The techniques used were the Random Forest classifier and Decision tree which were used to analyse and classify crimes into low, medium and high crimes. In comparison to the Decision tree, the Random Forest classifier outperformed it. Accuracy, precision, and recall for the Random Forest classifier are, respectively, 77%, 77%, and 77%. However, the decision trees’ values for accuracy, precision, and recall are 75%, 75%, and 76%, respectively. Additionally, a map of crime hotspots was created using an analysis of Chicago’s historical crime data to show security agencies where crimes are most likely to occur\nKey methods and Data\nData mining techniques (decision trees and random forest classifiers) for crime prediction and analysis, Spatial clustering, Secondary data obtained from Chicago Police Department Statistics Portal\nTools\nOpenstreetmap, Google colab"
