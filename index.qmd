# About me

**Background**

A Geomatic Engineer with extensive experience in GIS, land surveying, and environmental management, focused on applying precise spatial data solutions to mining, construction, and infrastructure projects. I have developed practical expertise in site layout, topographic mapping, road profiling, land demarcation, and generating high-resolution orthophotos using advanced surveying instruments and drone technology. My professional experience spans roles as a Geomatic Engineer, Assistant Surveyor, and Survey Assistant, where I was responsible for setting out structural equipment, verifying excavation levels, establishing control points, and producing accurate survey documentation to guide engineering and environmental decision-making. Through rigorous training and hands-on practice in spatial data analysis, remote sensing, geospatial modelling, GIS-based mapping, Google Earth Engine, Python, and R, I have honed the ability to integrate field data with analytical tools effectively. This combination of field experience and technical expertise enables the delivery of reliable, actionable spatial information that informs sustainable land use, resource planning, and environmental management.
