# About me

**Background**

I am a graduate student in the Master of Geomatics for Environmental Management program at the University of British Columbia, working at the intersection of GIS, land surveying, and environmental management. I am passionate about using spatial data and geomatics tools to understand and address real-world environmental challenges. My training and hands-on experience in GIS, remote sensing, and coding with R, Python, and Google Earth Engine enable me to translate complex datasets into actionable insights that support sustainable land use, resource planning, and environmental decision-making. I enjoy connecting field data with analytical tools to inform practical solutions and drive positive environmental outcomes. With extensive experience in land surveying and spatial analysis, I apply precision, technology, and environmental knowledge to solve practical problems. Combining coding, survey work, and spatial analysis has strengthened my ability to deliver accurate, actionable information that supports communities, organizations, and decision-makers in planning and managing resources responsibly. I am committed to advancing environmental management through the practical application of geomatics and survey expertise, translating data into solutions that make a tangible impact.
